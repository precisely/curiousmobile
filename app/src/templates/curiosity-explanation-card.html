	Every night our algorithms look at your 
	data to find possible relationships 
	between your tags. You can sort these 
	curiosities by rating them to tell us 
	whether you think the algorithms have 
	come up with something meaningful to 
	you ("SIGNAL") or something you think 
	is not meaningful or interesting ("NOISE").
